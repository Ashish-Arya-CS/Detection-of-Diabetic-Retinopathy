# Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy
  This is a model for detection of Diabetic Retinopathy.Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems.You might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy.

Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes.

## The Model has been trained on Colab using a GPU Hardware Accelerator
  The Dataset was taken from Kaggle and here is the link for the [DATA}(https://www.kaggle.com/sovitrath/diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered?)
